The Tempotron model \cite{gutig2006tempotron}, introduced by GÃ¼tig and Sompolinsky in 2006, is a neural network model that focuses on temporal coding and processing of information in spiking neural networks. It builds upon previous research in computational neuroscience and aims to capture the temporal dynamics of neural networks, specifically in the context of pattern recognition tasks. The Tempotron model has garnered attention and been extensively studied in the field, including its application on datasets such as the MNIST dataset, which is widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.
