In the scientific background, we provided an overview of the Perceptron model and its associated algorithms and methodologies, which serve as foundational elements for today's remarkable advancements and capabilities. 

The scientific background highlights the growing interest within the scientific community towards computational neuron models, which offer a more biologically plausible approach to modeling neural systems. Furthermore, the development of Neuromorphic hardware can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of these models.

Our objective is to explore fundamental methods and algorithms employed in the Perceptron model context and adapt them to the Tempotron. We aim to gain insights into their relative strengths and limitations by comparing these models across various tasks and methodologies. Through this exploration, we strive to contribute to the broader understanding of the capabilities and applicability of these models in different domains.
