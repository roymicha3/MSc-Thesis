\subsection{Population Encoding}

We shall now delve into various strategies to adopt the population encoding method. Our focus is to utilize this approach in a manner that leverages the salient features of the data, harnesses the unique characteristics of the neuron model, and employs the diverse encoding methodologies we have previously explored in \ref{ch:computational-models}.

As we discussed in section \ref{ch:computational-models}, we can integrate different
