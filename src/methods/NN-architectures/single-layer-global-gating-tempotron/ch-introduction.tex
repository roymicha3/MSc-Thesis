\subsubsection{Introduction}

Now we can proceed to another approach - Tempotron gated linear network: 
First, let's look at the basic definitions:
Each neuron from one layer will be connected to the next neuron by \(M\) dendritic connections with different weights and gates functions \( \{ g_m(x) \}^M_{m=1}\).

* To simplify the indexing expressions, I'm referring to \(x\) as a simple data sample instead of \(x_{\mu}\) for the \(\mu\)-th sample.
