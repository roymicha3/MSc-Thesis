\subsubsection{Initialization}

We will calculate the presynaptic trace matrix for each pattern (we need to do it only once!)

The initial value of our weights:

\begin{equation}
    w_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{l}} \cdot \mathbf{1}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{1}$ is a column vector with all elements equal to 1.
