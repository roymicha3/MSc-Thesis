\subsubsection{Basic Definitions}

For input spikes in the form of spike times â€“ each input sample is a set of spike time series:
\( \lbrace{t_{i,j}^{\mu}} \rbrace_{i, j}\) \text{ = the time of the j\textsuperscript{th} spike of the i\textsuperscript{th} input neuron sample \(\mu\)}

The input layer filters the incoming delta train (earlier denoted as spike trains) with the kernel function as mentioned in equation \ref{eq:cuba-model}.

\begin{equation}
    v_k(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i,k} \cdot x_i(t), \quad x_i(t) = \sum_{t_{i,j} < t} k(t - t_{i,j}^{\mu})
\end{equation}

s.t. \(w_k\) = the weight vector of the k\textsuperscript{th} output neuron
