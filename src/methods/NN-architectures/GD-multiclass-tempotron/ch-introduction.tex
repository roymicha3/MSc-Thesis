\subsubsection{Introduction}

The next step will be training a fully connected singles layer Tempotron net by “cross entropy” loss.
We are suggesting a novel architecture which is based on the tempotron and known methods from neural networks such as SoftMax activation and cross entropy loss. We integrated these methods by reducing the dimensionality of the output.
