\subsection{Spike Encoders}


Understanding how to translate typical data, such as pixel values from images or scalar values, into spike trains is key to working with neural models. Spike trains, which are sequences of neuron firing activities, act as a sort of language that these models use to handle and process information. 

In this section, we will discuss some of the common methods used to encode this kind of data into spike trains. Each method has its own approach to the transformation and is suited for different types of data or applications. We aim to provide a clear overview of these encoding strategies, exploring how they work, their advantages and drawbacks, and where they can best be applied.
